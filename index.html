                <p>We have upgraded our K-2 playground due to several requests from students. We now include a tire swing, 5 sets of swings, 4 slides, and lots of other playground fun! Not only that, we have added an obstacle course for students to try! We always try to keep everyone safe at playgrounds, so we have hired 7 voluntary lunch duties to watch out for the little ones. We have painted our new upgrade in bright and vibrant colors, so recess never seems dull. We put sand as the base, because lots have been getting hurt while on the monkey bars due to the rough texture of the previous tambark, and we need to take action and stop that. On the subject of monkey bars, we have made new and easier patterns for the younger kids. And lastly, we also included a trampoline with tall net borders, so kids can have good ol' safety fun! </p>

                <p>We didn't have that many clubs before, and we realized that our students needed them! Clubs inspire students to use their creativity, problem solving skills, organization, and passion. Not only that, clubs prepare students to work in a team, which they will absolutely use later on. Now, St. Ludington's School offers Reading, Music, Art, Drama, Orchestra, Band, Applied Engineering, Extra PE, Dance, Yoga, Creative Writing, and Advanced Math and Science. This way, students can be at their best, and wow both themselves, and their superiors!</p>
